# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation of Cloudwhistle. It provides an in-depth explanation of the product features and how they work.

### What is Cloudwhistle?

Cloudwhistle is a **real-time** cloud monitoring system that **alerts** you when your cloud costs are getting out of hand.

### Well, how does it work?

Simply put, it scans your cloud accounts resources & metrics regularly and compares the current cost to a budget you set. If the current cost exceeds the budget, it sends you an alert. _Keep in mind that it only covers some the cloud services and is only a heuristic._
